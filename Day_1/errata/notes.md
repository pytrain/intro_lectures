Why do you need a trailing comma within a tuple, list, or dictionary?
```python

>>> single = (1)
>>> type(single)
<class 'int'>
>>> single_tuple = (1,)
>>> type(single_tuple)
<class 'tuple'>
```

```python

>>> a = [
...     'some',
...     'thing'
...     'weird'
... ]
>>> 
>>> a
['some', 'thingweird']
```
